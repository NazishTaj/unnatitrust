                        The primary objective of the Unnati Educational and Charitable Trust is to encourage financially weak and deserving students to pursue higher education. The trust supports such students by taking full responsibility for their college tuition fees.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The trust aims to improve the country’s Gross Enrollment Ratio by helping needy students enroll in higher education. Students with at least 50% marks in Class 10 or 12 can apply.

                    <p align="justify">
                        The financial support provided by the trust is a scholarship, not a loan, and students are not required to repay the college fees.
